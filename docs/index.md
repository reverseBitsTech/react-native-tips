# Important Lessons learned while learning React Native



## Uses of components: functional, class components

#### Functional components

When you **just wants to return some JSX** from a component then use functional level component

Example:

```jsx
const Button = () => {	
	return(
        <View> click me </View>
     );
}
```

Like here we don't perform any operation other than returning a View.

#### Class level components

when you wants to use **lifecycle methods and and do complex things** with states, prefer class level components as they are more powerful.

```jsx
class Button extends Component {
 		 // A react lifecycle method...
  		 componentWillMount() {
       		//Here do something relative...
   		 }
       render() {
        return (
            <View>
              <Text>
                </Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}
```





## De structuring of objects

#### At component level

Whenever you **want to fetch multiple things from a JS object** like you have multiple styles defined inside styles object:

```jsx
const styles = {
    viewStyle: {
        backgroundColor: '#F8F8F8',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        elevation: 8,
        position: 'relative'
    },
    textStyle: {
        fontSize: 20
    }
}
```

And now you want to access these both at some place, then use de structuring of objects so instead of writing like this :

```jsx
<View style={this.styles.viewStyle}>
     <Text style={this.styles.textStyle}> {props.headerText} </Text>
</View>
```

1.  First make a different constant

    ```jsx
    const { textStyle, viewStyle } = styles;
    ```

2.  Use it directly this way, 

    ```jsx
    <View style={viewStyle}>
        <Text style={textStyle}> {props.headerText} </Text>
    </View>
    ```

This makes code lot **more readable and clean** ;)


#### At files level

There will be certain times when you have lot of reusable components in your app, de structuring can save lot lines of code here.

**STEPS**

1.  **Make a common directory/package** for all re-usable components and **create an index.js file** inside that directory.

2.  Now for each component instead of exporting it like this 

    ```jsx
    export default component
    ```

3.  **export** it as **an object**.

    ```jsx
    export { Component}
    ```

4.  Inside index.js file what we simply do is **import all the components in same directory and immediately export them**. but with different syntax:

    ```jsx
    export * from './Button';
    export * from './Card';
    ```

5.  Now **whenever you write directory path** in which **any index.js file exists** then it will **by default load data from index file**. That's why we called it index 1st place.

    ```jsx
    import { Card, CardSection, Button, Input, Spinner } from './common'
    ```

    â€‹

## Declaring functional components in different ways...

This below codes are same, You can create components this way

#### Return should be in same line if One Line is gonna return

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <Text> Swesome </Text>
}
```



#### You can omit return statement if only single component is a return

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <View> </View> 
)
```



#### Full declaration, here returned items are mostly multiple

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (    
     <Text> 2nd Way </Text>
     <Text> 3rd Way </Text>
  );
}
```





## Redux - Simplest understanding...

There are **4 things** to learn

1.  **State**: Application's Data.
2.  **Action**: Plain JavaScript object that tells reducer how to modify the data [State].
3.  **Reduce** : The function that takes the action and make changes in State.
4.  **Store** : It holds a reference to State and Reducer.

//put images here

```
/*
	First we created a reducer, there are 2 arguments we pass
	1> state is the previous state we got while running reducer 
	2> action is the actual action object
*/
const reducer = (state = [], action) => {
  if(action === 'split_string'){
    return action.payload.split('');
  }
  return state;
}

//We need to pass reducer to the store.
const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

//This is the action which must have property type
const action = {
  type : 'split_string',
  payload : 'reverseBits'
}

//We need to pass this action to the store
store.dispatch(action);

//Any time you write this it will return current state.
store.getState();
```
