# Important Lessons learned while learning React Native



### Uses of components: functional, class components

#### Functional components

When you **just wants to return some JSX** from a component then use functional level component

Example:

```jsx
const Button = () => {	

     return(

        <View> click me </View>

     );

}
```

Like here we don't perform any operation other than returning a View.

#### Class level components

when you wants to use **lifecycle methods and and do complex things** with states, prefer class level components as they are more powerful.

```jsx
class Button extends Component {

 		 // A react lifecycle method...
  		 componentWillMount() {
       		//Here do something relative...
   		 }
  
        render() {

        return (

            <View>

                <Text>

                </Text>

            </View>

        );

    }

}
```





### De structuring of objects

#### At component level

Whenever you **want to fetch multiple things from a JS object** like you have multiple styles defined inside styles object:

```jsx
const styles = {

    viewStyle: {

        backgroundColor: '#F8F8F8',

        justifyContent: 'center',

        alignItems: 'center',

        elevation: 8,

        position: 'relative'

    },

    textStyle: {

        fontSize: 20

    }

}
```

And now you want to access these both at some place, then use de structuring of objects so instead of writing like this :

```jsx
<View style={this.styles.viewStyle}>

     <Text style={this.styles.textStyle}> {props.headerText} </Text>

</View>
```

1.  First make a different constant

    ```jsx
    const { textStyle, viewStyle } = styles;
    ```

2.  Use it directly this way, 

    ```jsx
    <View style={viewStyle}>

        <Text style={textStyle}> {props.headerText} </Text>

    </View>
    ```

This makes code lot **more readable and clean** ;)



#### At files level

There will be certain times when you have lot of reusable components in your app, de structuring can save lot lines of code here.

**STEPS**

1.  **Make a common directory/package** for all re-usable components and **create an index.js file** inside that directory.

2.  Now for each component instead of exporting it like this 

    ```jsx
    export default component
    ```

3.  **export** it as **an object**.

    ```jsx
    export { Component}
    ```

4.  Inside index.js file what we simply do is **import all the components in same directory and immediately export them**. but with different syntax:

    ```jsx
    export * from './Button';
    export * from './Card';
    ```

5.  Now **whenever you write directory path** in which **any index.js file exists** then it will **by default load data from index file**. That's why we called it index 1st place.

    ```jsx
    import { Card, CardSection, Button, Input, Spinner } from './common'
    ```

### Declaring functional components in different ways...

This below codes are same, You can create components this way

#### 1. Return should be in same line if One Line is gonna return

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <Text> Swesome </Text>
}
```



#### 2. You can omit return statement if only single component is a return

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <View> </View> 
)
```



#### 3. Full declaration, here returned items are mostly multiple

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (    
     <Text> 2nd Way </Text>
     <Text> 3rd Way </Text>
  );
}
```
